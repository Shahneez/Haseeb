      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="bioText">The Nightingale or Polar Diagram was developed by statistician and medical reformer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a>. During the Crimean War in 1854, Nightingale arrived in Turkey to work as a nurse. She took meticulous notes of the causes of death of the soldiers and following the war, Nightingale released her 'Notes on Matters Affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army'. In these she included the polar diagram to illustrate the various causes of death of soldiers during the war starting July 1854 through the end of the following year. Nightingale's diagram, shown in the image below, highlights that many more soldiers died from treatable diseases than battlefield wounds.</p>

      <p class="bioText">The Nightingale chart, as shown above, resembles a pie chart. Each sector has the same angle and thus, each category is divided into equal segments. The segments advance in a clockwise manner to plot a cyclic phenomena. The diagram above shows the number of deaths in each month after the troops landed in the Crimea. The size of each segment is determined by its distance from the center. The segments in the diagram above begin reaching outward in the radial direction as the number of deaths increased. An interactive reproduction of Florence Nightingale's original diagram can be found <a href="https://understandinguncertainty.org/coxcombs">here</a>.<br><br>A polar diagram can be created in excel by combing a donut chart and XY scatter chart. The chart is laid out on a polar coordinate system. Rings of the polar grid can be used as a scale to plot the size of the segment. Thus, the value of a segment is represented by its area rather than the radius (see diagram below). Scaling data using radius instead of area would also mislead the reader since the eyes inherently focus on area. However, this also means that the outer segments of the diagram are given more emphasis because of their larger area, thus, disproportionately representing increases in value. </p>
